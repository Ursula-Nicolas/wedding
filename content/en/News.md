## What's new to report?

1.    Our wedding planner will be replaced because of personal reasons - now **Carolin Sch√∂nball** is the person in charge. We trust Caro and 
if you have any questions you can contact her under c.schoenball[@]gmx.de.

2.    Event program: In case someone of you wishes to add an activity in the program, let Caro know so that she can keep the overview in sight and can help you in 
case you need something.

3.    Now the unromantic but important part: Covid-19. We have already mentioned on our website that we will organise a **hygiene concept** and will strictly 
stick to the Corona rules of Rheinland-Pfalz (the area in which we are celebrating). Rheinland-Pfalz has a so called **2G+ warning system** including three warning 
levels (see https://corona.rlp.de/de/aktuelles/corona-regeln-im-ueberblick/ ). In the moment we are still under level 1 regulations (the less strict one), however, 
this might change until the 20th of November.<br>
Each guest which has not been vaccinated against Covid-19 or recovered within the last 6 month has to make a test and bring the negative test result with him/her 
to the wedding (not older than 24h, a self-test or any other test is currently valid). We would like to ask vaccinated and recovered guests to bring their proof 
of immunisation with as well. Furthermore, we would like to ask everyone (including the immunised guests) to make a Covid-19 self-test. Doing so we have an extra 
security and peace of mind ensuring that everyone stays safe and healthy.

4.    Because several guests asked us: we do not have any wedding gift list of any kind as we do not have any needs in terms of physical gifts. The biggest present 
you can give us is that you will come to the wedding. However, if you want to support us to finance our wedding and our honeymoon, we will set up a box 
for cards at the wedding.
