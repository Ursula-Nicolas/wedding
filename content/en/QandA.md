## Registry and Presents
The biggest present you can offer us is to come to our wedding and celebrate with us. We do not have any wishes in terms of physical gifts, however, 
if you want to support us to finance our wedding and our honeymoon we will set up a box for cards at the wedding.


## Where to tell us that you are coming
Under this link ([RSVP]({{< ref "RSVP" >}} "RSVP")) you can send your answer, if you will make it to our wedding. Just fill in the form and press the sent button at the end.

## Dress code...
...does not exist on our wedding. That means that you can dress in the cloths you are most comfortable with. As the wedding will take place in November we highly recommend to bring an extra layer in case you run cold.
