## What we might have to consider

Here we will update you about the latest news regarding Covid-19 restrictions etc.

We indeed hope, that we can celebrate with all of you.
However, it might be that we have to restrict ourselves in terms of number of guests or other guidelines we have to consider.
That means that we might be forced to reduce the number of guests in retrospect or have to commit other changes to the plan.
We will, though, keep you posted and inform you about changes as soon as possible.

In the moment we are allowed to celebrate with up to 100 people - vaccinated and recovered guests not added. 
Even if the region does not necessarily requires a hygiene plan, we will take care to include specific hygiene rules.

We want explicitly say, that we are not mad on ANYONE, who decides to not come to our wedding due to Corona.

Information about the region Rheinland-Phalz and its Corona rules can also be found on (https://corona.rlp.de/de/startseite/ unfortunately only in German) or on the main page of the German government (https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/einreiseundaufenthalt/coronavirus in English).
