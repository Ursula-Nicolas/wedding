<p>Here we will update you about the latest news regarding Covid-19 restrictions etc.</p>
<p>We indeed hope that we can celebrate with all of you. However, it might be that we have to restrict ourselves in terms of number of guests or 
other guidelines we have to consider. That means that we might be forced to reduce the number of guests in retrospect or must commit other changes to the plan.
We will, though, keep you posted and inform you about changes as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We will organise a <strong>hygiene concept</strong> and will strictly follow the Corona rules of Rheinland-Pfalz (the area in which we are celebrating). Rheinland-Pfalz 
has a so-called <strong>2G+ warning system</strong> of three warning levels (see <a href="https://corona.rlp.de/de/aktuelles/corona-regeln-im-ueberblick/">https://corona.rlp.de/de/aktuelles/corona-regeln-im-ueberblick/</a> ). In the moment we are 
still under level 1 regulations (the less strict one), however, this might change up to the 20th of November.<br></p>
<p>The Corona rules in Rheinland-Pfalz states the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level one allows up to 25, level two allows 10 and level three up to 5 non-immunised guests (so not vaccinated or not recovered). If these rules are followed, 
we can have a non-mask and non-distance policy (so no masks are non compulsory and we can dance). We are fortuned to be definitely under the limit before level two so far.</li>
<li>Immunised guests are not restricted in numbers (indeed we have to stick to the rules of the Hofgut).</li>
<li>We have to register the contacts of ALL our guests (which you have already done through registering on our homepage).</li>
<li>Non-immunised guests HAVE to be tested before the venue, 24h or less before the event starts. As far as we have understood a self-test is sufficient in the moment.</li>
<li>Guests which are under 12 years of age or are immunised do not have to test themselves / do not need to get tested.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, each guest which has not been vaccinated against Covid-19 or recovered within the last 6 months has to make a test and bring the negative test result with to the 
wedding (not older than 24h, a self-test or any other test is possible in the moment). We would like to ask vaccinated and recovered guests to bring their proof 
of immunisation with as well. Furthermore, we would like to ask everyone (including the immunised guests) to make a Covid-19 self-test. Doing so we have an extra security 
that everyone stays safe and healthy.</p>
<p>We want explicitly say that we wonâ€™t have any hard feeling on ANYONE, who decides to not come to our wedding due to Corona, what matter most is for you to stay safe and healthy, 
the decision is yours and only yours.</p>
<p>Information about the region Rheinland-Pfalz and its Corona rules can also be found on (<a href="https://corona.rlp.de/de/startseite/">https://corona.rlp.de/de/startseite/</a> unfortunately only in German) or on the main 
page of the German government (<a href="https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/einreiseundaufenthalt/coronavirus">https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/einreiseundaufenthalt/coronavirus</a> in English).</p>
